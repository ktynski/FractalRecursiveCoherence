## TODO 1: NS Full Nonlinear Testing

### Root Cause
Full nonlinear NS with vortex stretching term never tested. Previous tests used diffusion-only.

### Current Status
- ✅ Solver implemented (`test_full_ns_convergence.py`, 336 lines)
- ✅ Quick validation complete (32³, t=2.0, runs correctly)
- ⏳ Medium test ready (64³, t=10.0, ~30 min)
- ⏳ Long test ready (64³, t=50.0, ~3 hrs)

### Resolution Path
**Week 1**:
- Run Test 2 (medium, t=10.0)
- Run Test 3 (long, t=50.0) overnight
- Analyze R(t) trajectories

**Week 2**:
- Run multiple IC types (Taylor-Green, Random, Vortex Ring)
- Vary parameters (ν, Re, grid size)
- Document convergence behavior

### Success Criteria
- **Minimum** (85%): R(t) shows clear trend toward φ⁻²
- **Full** (95%): R(t) within 10% of φ⁻² for multiple tests
- **Clay-level** (99%): R(t) within 5% of φ⁻², robust to parameters

### Deliverables
1. `NS_CONVERGENCE_RESULTS.md` - Complete test results
2. Plots of R(t) for all tests
3. Statistical analysis of convergence
4. Paper section update with numerical validation

### Time Estimate: 1-2 weeks (mostly compute time)

## TODO 2: Yukawa Derivation (SU(5) Clebsch-Gordan)

### Root Cause
Muon mass formula $m_\mu = (10N-3)m_e$ has coefficient "10" from "SU(5) 10-representation" but not rigorously derived.

### Current Status
- ✅ Framework exists (`compute_su5_clebsch_gordan.py`)
- ✅ Basic CG coefficients implemented ($1/\sqrt{5}$ for diagonal)
- ❌ Wave function overlap not computed
- ❌ RG running not computed
- ❌ Coefficient 10 not derived

### Resolution Path

**Step 1: Wave Function Overlap** (3-4 days)
```python
def topology_wave_function_overlap(gen_i, gen_j, N=21):
    """
    Compute ∫ ψ_i(x) ψ_j(x) dx over Ring+Cross graph.
    
    For muon (gen 1) vs electron (gen 0):
    - Electron: nodes 0-6 (sector 1, θ=0-2π/3)
    - Muon: nodes 7-13 (sector 2, θ=2π/3-4π/3)
    - Overlap depends on node spacing and cross-link structure
    """
    # Implementation based on graph Laplacian eigenstates
    ...
```

**Step 2: RG Running** (2-3 days)
```python
def rg_yukawa_running(y_GUT, M_GUT=2e16, M_Z=91.2):
    """
    RG evolution from GUT scale to EW scale.
    
    β(y) = y/16π² × [C_y - g₃² - 3g₂² - Y²g₁²]
    
    For leptons: C_y ≈ 3/2 (from SU(5) structure)
    """
    ...
```

**Step 3: Full Derivation** (2-3 days)
```
Yukawa_μ = (CG coeff) × (wave overlap) × (RG running)
         = (1/√5) × (overlap) × (running)
         ≈ 0.447 × α_overlap × β_running
         
Goal: Show α_overlap × β_running ≈ 10/0.447 ≈ 22.4
```

**Step 4: Validation** (1-2 days)
- Compute for all three generations
- Check electron (gen 0): coefficient = 1
- Check muon (gen 1): coefficient ≈ 10
- Check tau (gen 2): coefficient ≈ 248/N ≈ 11.8

### Success Criteria
- Derive coefficient 10 ± 20% from first principles
- Same method works for tau (248/N)
- No free parameters, only topology (N=21)

### Deliverables
1. `YUKAWA_COMPLETE_DERIVATION.md`
2. Extended `compute_su5_clebsch_gordan.py` with all functions
3. Test file validating all mass ratios
4. Paper section update with rigorous derivation

### Time Estimate: 2-3 weeks

## TODO 3: VEV Exponents Derivation

### Root Cause
Higgs VEV formula $v = \sqrt{3} M_P \alpha \pi^3 / (\phi^{21} N^9)$ has exponents justified by dimensional analysis, not symmetry breaking.

### Current Status
- ✅ Formula is numerically accurate (0.026% error)
- ✅ Symmetry breaking chain documented (E8→E7→E6→SO(10)→SU(5)→SM)
- ❌ Exponents (√3, π³, N⁹, φ²¹) not rigorously derived

### Resolution Path

**Step 1: Map Exponents to Breaking Steps** (1 week)

For each step E8 → E7 → E6 → SO(10) → SU(5) → SM:
1. Compute rank decrease (Δr)
2. Compute dimension decrease (Δd)
3. Identify topological factors from N=21
4. Track φ accumulation

**Expected pattern**:
```
E8 → E7: Δr=1, contribution: φ^k₁ × N^m₁
E7 → E6: Δr=1, contribution: φ^k₂ × N^m₂
E6 → SO(10): Δr=2, contribution: φ^k₃ × N^m₃
SO(10) → SU(5): Δr=1, contribution: φ^k₄ × N^m₄
SU(5) → SM: Δr=2, contribution: φ^k₅ × N^m₅

Total: φ^(Σk_i) × N^(Σm_i) = φ^21 × N^9
```

**Step 2: Geometric Factors** (3-4 days)
- **√3**: From 3 generations or 3D space?
  - Hypothesis: Dimension of SU(5) 5̄ representation
  - Alternative: √(Tr(T_a T_a)) for SU(3)
  
- **π³**: From 3D volume or loop integrals?
  - Hypothesis: ∫d³k/(2π)³ from loop corrections
  - Alternative: Volume factor in compactified space

**Step 3: Rigorous Calculation** (1 week)
```python
def vev_from_breaking_chain(M_P, alpha, N=21):
    """
    Compute VEV from E8 symmetry breaking.
    
    At each step:
    - Track energy scale reduction
    - Accumulate topological factors
    - Include loop corrections
    """
    ...
```

### Success Criteria
- Each exponent derived from specific breaking step
- No dimensional analysis, only group theory + topology
- Formula remains v = (derived constant) × parameters

### Deliverables
1. `VEV_EXPONENTS_RIGOROUS_DERIVATION.md`
2. Python module computing VEV from breaking chain
3. Table showing each exponent's origin
4. Paper section update

### Time Estimate: 2-3 weeks

## TODO 4: E8 Uniqueness (12N-4=248)

### Root Cause
"12 degrees of freedom per node" comes from "octonions (8) + spinors (4)" but not proven unique from E8 structure.

### Current Status
- ✅ Formula 12N-4=248 gives N=21 ✓
- ✅ N=21 is Fibonacci F(8) ✓
- ✅ 21=3×7 explains 3 generations ✓
- ❌ "12 DOF" not derived from E8
- ❌ "4 constraints" not proven unique

### Resolution Path

**Step 1: E8 Root System Analysis** (2 weeks)
- E8 has 240 roots in 8D
- Cartan subalgebra: 8 dimensions
- Weight lattice: E8*/E8 quotient
- Objective: Find natural 21-cell decomposition

**Hypothesis**: E8 decomposes into 21 "orbits" under specific subgroup:
```
E8 ⊃ SO(16) ⊃ SO(10) × SO(6) ⊃ SU(5) × SU(3) × ...

Each orbit corresponds to one node of Ring+Cross.
Each orbit has 12 internal states (octonions + spinors).
```

**Step 2: Prove 12 DOF from E8** (2 weeks)
- **Option A**: E8 stabilizer subgroup has dim=12
- **Option B**: E8/(E8 quotient) = 21-cell complex, each cell dim=12
- **Option C**: E8 lattice projection onto discrete graph

**Step 3: Prove 4 Constraints from Topology** (1 week)
- Global U(1) phase: -1 DOF
- Momentum conservation: -3 DOF
- Total: -4 DOF ✓

But must prove these are the ONLY constraints.

**Step 4: Uniqueness Proof** (1 week)
- Show 12N-4=248 has unique integer solution N=21
- Show other N values don't satisfy topological requirements
- Prove no other decomposition is consistent

### Success Criteria
- Derive "12 DOF per node" from E8 group theory
- Prove "4 constraints" are unique and complete
- Show N=21 is the ONLY solution

### Deliverables
1. `E8_UNIQUENESS_COMPLETE_PROOF.md`
2. Python module for E8 root system analysis
3. Proof document suitable for mathematical journal
4. Paper section update

### Time Estimate: 4-6 weeks (most complex)

## TODO 5: Yang-Mills Equivalence

### Root Cause
Yang-Mills coercivity $C>1$ is proven within FSCTF, but equivalence to standard YM is asserted, not proven.

### Current Status
- ✅ FSCTF-YM has coercivity (proven)
- ✅ Mass gap $\Delta m = 0.899$ GeV (matches lattice)
- ❌ Standard YM ≟ FSCTF-YM equivalence unproven
- ❌ Grace emergence from YM Lagrangian not shown

### Resolution Path

**Step 1: Identify Grace in Standard YM** (2 weeks)
- Standard YM Lagrangian: $\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F^a_{\mu\nu}F^{a,\mu\nu}$
- Gauge fixing: $-\frac{1}{2\xi}(\partial_\mu A^\mu_a)^2$
- **Hypothesis**: Gauge fixing term IS the Grace operator

**Test**: Check if gauge fixing satisfies Grace axioms:
- G1 (Positivity): ✓ (penalty term is positive)
- G2 (Contraction): ? (need to check κ<1)
- G3 (Coercivity): ? (need to prove C>1)
- G4 (Selfadjoint): ✓ (symmetric in Hilbert space)

**Step 2: Measure κ from Lattice** (1 week)
- Use existing lattice YM simulations
- Measure contraction rate of high-frequency modes
- Compare to φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618

**Step 3: Formal Equivalence Proof** (2 weeks)
```
Show: YM Hamiltonian with gauge fixing 
      ≡ FSCTF Hamiltonian with Grace operator
      
via unitary transformation or field redefinition
```

### Success Criteria
- Prove standard YM (with gauge fixing) satisfies Grace axioms
- Measure κ from lattice, compare to theoretical φ⁻¹
- Establish formal equivalence

### Deliverables
1. `YANG_MILLS_GRACE_EQUIVALENCE.md`
2. Lattice analysis code
3. Formal proof document
4. Paper section update

### Time Estimate: 3-4 weeks
