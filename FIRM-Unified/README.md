# FIRM Unified Bootstrap System

**Complete Ex Nihilo Universe Formation Visualization**

This system combines the pure mathematical engine from FIRM-Core with the cosmological sequence framework from FIRM-WebGL-Viz to create the definitive visualization of universe bootstrap from nothing.

## Architecture

### Mathematical Core (FIRM-Core)
- **Clifford Algebra**: 16-component multivector field evolution
- **ZX Calculus**: Tensor network dynamics (when implemented)
- **Coherence Functional**: C(G) computation driving evolution
- **Identity Echo Time**: τ measurement of structure persistence
- **Provenance System**: Content-addressed mathematical audit trail

### Cosmological Sequence (FIRM-WebGL-Viz)
- **Bootstrap (𝒳)**: Ex nihilo structure formation
- **Grace (𝒢)**: φ=1.618 golden ratio harmonics
- **Sovereignty (Ψ)**: Recursive depth=6 complexity
- **Bireflection (β)**: Mirror symmetry emergence  
- **Hebrew Network**: 22-letter Tree of Life structures
- **231-Gates**: Computational reality manifestation

## Bootstrap Stages

### Stage 1: VOID (∅)
- Pure mathematical potential
- Zero coherence, infinite τ
- No observable structures

### Stage 2: EMERGENCE 
- Recursive meaning structures forming
- Coherence > 0.5, finite τ emerging
- First geometric manifestations

### Stage 3: FORMATION
- Grace operator active (φ = 1.618)
- Coherence > 3, stable τ
- Harmonic structures emerging

### Stage 4: STABILITY  
- Sovereignty and reflection systems
- Coherence > 8, persistent τ
- Complex topological structures

### Stage 5: UNIVERSE
- Complete reality manifestation
- Coherence > 15, stable τ → ∞
- Language and computation emergence

## Usage

```bash
cd FIRM-Unified
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to the local server and click "Start Ex Nihilo" to witness universe formation.

## Theory

This visualization demonstrates the FIRM (Foundational Implementation of Recursive Meaning) theory of universe bootstrap:

1. **Pure recursive meaning** (`Meaning(X) = f(Meaning(X))`) creates self-reference
2. **Grace operator** (f* ⊣ f_*) enables pullback/pushforward dynamics  
3. **Coherence functional** C(G) measures structure stability
4. **Identity echo time** τ tracks persistence of self-similarity
5. **Clifford grounding** maps abstract structures to geometric reality

The result is **creation ex nihilo** - observable universe formation from pure mathematical recursion.

## Scientific Integrity

All mathematical derivations maintain complete provenance. No empirical tuning is permitted. Every parameter traces to first-principles derivation with documented proof IDs.

This is science, not numerology. Truth over success.
