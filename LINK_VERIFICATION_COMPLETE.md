## Summary

All README.md links have been verified and fixed.

## Changes Made

### Fixed Broken Links

**Millennium Prize Problems** (lines 12-14):
- Removed references to non-existent proof documents
- Removed references to non-existent test files
- Kept only working implementation links

**Before**:
```
YANG_MILLS_MASS_GAP_PROOF.md (didn't exist)
NAVIER_STOKES_SMOOTHNESS_PROOF.md (didn't exist)
RIEMANN_HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION.md (didn't exist)
tests/test_yang_mills.py (didn't exist)
tests/test_navier_stokes_smooth.py (didn't exist)
tests/test_riemann_hypothesis.py (didn't exist)
```

**After**:
```
FIRM-Core/FIRM_dsl/yang_mills_mass_gap.py ✓
FIRM-Core/FIRM_dsl/navier_stokes_smooth.py ✓
FIRM-Core/FIRM_dsl/riemann_critical_line.py ✓
```
