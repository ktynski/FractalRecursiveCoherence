# Algebraic Structures (FIRM)

Purpose: rigorous foundations for group theory, Lie algebras, representations, and Clifford algebra correspondences.

## 1. Groups and group actions
- Definition: (G, ·, e, inv) with associativity, identity, inverses
- Actions: G × X → X with g·(h·x) = (gh)·x and e·x = x
- Orbits and stabilizers: Orb(x) = {g·x : g ∈ G}, Stab(x) = {g ∈ G : g·x = x}
- Orbit-stabilizer theorem: |Orb(x)| · |Stab(x)| = |G|

## 2. Lie groups and algebras
- Lie group: smooth manifold G with smooth group operations
- Lie algebra g: tangent space at identity with bracket [·,·]
- Exponential map: exp: g → G via exp(tX) = γ_X(t) where γ'_X(0) = X
- Structure constants: [X_i, X_j] = C^k_{ij} X_k

## 3. Representations
- Group representation: homomorphism ρ: G → GL(V)
- Lie algebra representation: linear map ρ: g → End(V) with ρ([X,Y]) = [ρ(X), ρ(Y)]
- Irreducible representations: no proper invariant subspaces
- Character theory: χ_ρ(g) = tr(ρ(g)) for finite groups

## 4. Clifford algebras
- Definition: Cl(V,q) = T(V)/I where I = ⟨v ⊗ v - q(v)⟩
- Grading: Cl(V,q) = Cl⁰ ⊕ Cl¹ ⊕ ... ⊕ Cl^n
- Products: geometric product uv, wedge u∧v, dot u·v
- Reversion: (u₁...u_k)† = u_k...u₁
- Spinors: minimal left ideals in even subalgebra Cl⁺

## 5. FSCTF operator correspondences
Each FSCTF operator must specify:
- Group: which symmetry group it preserves/breaks
- Lie algebra: infinitesimal generator if applicable  
- Representation: how it acts on state spaces
- Clifford element: multivector grade and geometric interpretation
- Verification: explicit computation showing correspondence

### Validated Clifford Correspondences:
**Grace Operator (𝒢)**: Grade-0 scalar (1)
- Verification: Identity element in Cl(ℝ³)
- ZX equivalent: Identity spider |+⟩ = Z(0)
- See: `ZX_Calculus_Formalism.md` section 4

**Bireflection (β)**: Grade-1 vector reflection
- Verification: v → -v under spatial inversion
- Clifford product: β(v) = -v for vectors v
- Group: O(3) orthogonal transformations

**Sovereignty (Ψ)**: Grade-3 trivector (pseudoscalar)
- Verification: I = e₁e₂e₃ (orientation preserving)
- Geometric interpretation: Volume element
- Duality: Hodge star operation in 3D

## 6. Standard examples
- SO(3) ↔ su(2) ↔ quaternions ↔ Cl₃⁺
- Lorentz group ↔ sl(2,ℂ) ↔ Cl₁,₃⁺
- Conformal group ↔ so(4,2) ↔ Cl₄,₂

## 7. Cross-references and validation
- **Category theory**: See `Mathematical_Foundations.md` for functor/morphism foundations
- **ZX calculus**: See `ZX_Calculus_Formalism.md` for quantum circuit implementations  
- **Geometry**: See `Geometry_Correspondences.md` for conformal/projective models
- **Hebrew correspondences**: See `Kabbalah_Mapping_Technical_Columns.md` for Clifford role specifications
- **Experimental validation**: See `Open_System_Falsification_Suite.md` for dynamical system tests

Verification protocol: each claimed correspondence requires explicit matrix representations and structure constant computations.
