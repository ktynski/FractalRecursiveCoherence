# Geometry Correspondences (Formal)

Purpose: replace informal geometry with precise models, groups, and invariants.

## 1. Models
- Euclidean ‚Ñù^n with inner product ‚ü®¬∑,¬∑‚ü©; isometries: E(n)
- Affine space A^n; transformations: Aff(n)
- Projective space ‚Ñô^n; transformations: PGL(n+1)
- Conformal geometry via M√∂bius group in 2D (PSL(2,‚ÑÇ)) and via Clifford algebra conformal model (CGA) in higher dims

## 2. Constructions
- Circles/spheres: level sets of quadratic forms; lines/planes: affine subspaces
- Spirals/logarithmic spirals: polar equations r = a e^{bŒ∏}; invariants: angle of pitch
- Projections: linear or projective maps; Jacobians where differentiable

## 3. Invariants and group actions
- Euclidean: distances, angles
- Projective: cross-ratio; incidence structure
- Conformal: angles; circles/lines mapped to circles/lines
- For each mapping, state the acting group G and preserved invariants explicitly.

## 4. CGA (Clifford conformal model) sketch
- Embed ‚Ñù^n into null cone of ‚Ñù^{n+1,1}; represent points as null vectors P(x)
- Conformal transforms as versors; circles/lines as intersections of null quadrics
- Rotors/boosts encode rotations/dilations; provide grades and products for each operator realization.

## 5. Verification protocol (geometry)
- Declare model, coordinates, and transformation group
- Provide explicit construction equations (e.g., parametric or implicit forms)
- State invariants checked and show preservation under the map (symbolic where feasible)
- Link to ZX/GA representations when geometry encodes computation diagrams

## 6. FSCTF Geometric Validation
