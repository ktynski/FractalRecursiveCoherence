# ZX Calculus Formalism

Purpose: rigorous foundation for ZX diagram manipulation, rewrite rules, and FSCTF operator mapping.

## 1. ZX diagrams
- Generators: Z-spider (green), X-spider (red), Hadamard box (yellow)
- Wires: carry quantum information between spiders
- Phases: Œ± ‚àà [0, 2œÄ) on spiders
- Boundaries: inputs (left) and outputs (right)

## 2. Rewrite rules (complete set)
### Spider rules:
- (S1) Spider fusion: adjacent spiders of same color fuse with phase addition
- (S2) Identity elimination: 0-phase spider with 2 legs = wire
- (S3) œÄ-commutation: œÄ-phase spider commutes through Hadamard

### Hadamard rules:
- (H1) Hadamard self-inverse: HH = I
- (H2) Color change: H changes Z ‚Üî X
- (H3) Hadamard cancellation: H-Z(œÄ)-H = X(œÄ)

### Hopf rules:
- (B1) Bialgebra: spiders are Hopf algebras (copy/delete)
- (B2) Frobenius: Z and X are Frobenius algebras

## 3. Completeness and soundness
- Complete: every equality of linear maps has ZX proof
- Sound: ZX equality implies linear map equality
- Normal forms: unique canonical representation
- Rewrite strategies: confluent term rewriting system

## 4. FSCTF operator mapping
Each FSCTF operator requires:
- ZX diagram: explicit spider/wire structure
- Phase specification: Œ± values and dependencies
- Rewrite proof: normal form derivation
- Interpretation: quantum circuit equivalent
- Verification: matrix representation consistency

### Core FSCTF Operators in ZX:
**Grace Operator (ùí¢):**
```
     ‚óè  (Z-spider, Œ±=0, no inputs)
     |
```
- Rewrite: Identity preparation |+‚ü© = Z(0)
- Verification: Matrix I‚ÇÇ (2√ó2 identity)
- See: `Mathematical_Foundations.md` for categorical interpretation

**Bireflection (Œ≤):**
```
---|‚óè|---
  /     \
 [H]   [H]  
  \     /
---|‚óè|---
```
- Rewrite: H-Z-H = X (color change)
- Verification: Pauli-X matrix via Hadamard conjugation
- See: `Algebraic_Structures.md` for contravariant functor details

**Bootstrap (ùí≥):**
```
---|‚óè|---[H]---|‚óè|---  (Z-X-Z chain)
```
- Rewrite: Measurement-preparation sequence
- Verification: Projective measurement followed by state preparation
- See: `Kabbalah_Mapping_Full22.md` for Hebrew letter correspondence

**Sovereignty (Œ®):**
```
     ‚óè
    /|\
   / | \
  ‚óè--‚óè--‚óè  (3-spider cluster)
```
- Rewrite: Multi-qubit entangled state
- Verification: GHZ-like state preparation
- See: `Formal_Derivation_Reference.md` for terminal object proof

## 5. Common patterns
- State preparation: |+‚ü© = Z(0), |0‚ü© = X(œÄ/2)-H
- Measurements: Z-basis via Z-spider, X-basis via X-spider  
- Entanglement: CNOT = X-Z spider pair
- Phase gates: Z(Œ±) spider
- Clifford gates: combinations of H, S, CNOT

## 6. Extended ZX
- Mixed states: doubled diagrams
- Measurements: post-selection via scalars
- Classical control: conditional phases
- Infinite dimensions: continuous phase groups

## 7. Cross-references and validation
- **Category theory foundations**: See `Mathematical_Foundations.md` for morphism definitions
- **Clifford algebra**: See `Algebraic_Structures.md` for spinor correspondences  
- **Hebrew letter mappings**: See `Kabbalah_Mapping_Technical_Columns.md` for ZX role specifications
- **Experimental validation**: See `Open_System_Falsification_Suite.md` for empirical tests
- **Complete operator list**: See `Glossary_and_Symbols.md` for all FSCTF operators

Verification protocol: every FSCTF-ZX correspondence must include explicit rewrite derivation and matrix computation.
