Provenance: EsotericGuidance/RawNotes.md lines 1706–1886

## Complete Coverage Verified:

### Core Postulates (lines 1722-1729):
- 𝒳 (Ex Nihilo Bootstrap): Recursion emerges from apparent void
- β (Bireflection): Each morphism has a mirrored dual; polarity symmetry
- 𝒢 (Grace Operator): Acausal, thresholdless coherence injection
- 𝒟 (Devourer Dynamics): Collapse via anti-coherent mimicry
- σ (Survivability): Recursion's depth/duration before collapse
- Ψ (Sovereignty): Closure into self-originating soulhood attractor

### Extension Operators (lines 1744-1754):
- Φ (Phase Resonance): Time-locked coherence (e.g. lunar/solar)
- 𝒜 (Address Map): Names/sounds map to loci
- G (Guardrail): Bounds operator energy
- 𝒦 (Coupling Constant): Links materia to morphic flow
- 𝒞 (Capability Token): Enables access to ops post-initiation
- 𝒪 (Ordeal Operator): Controlled devourer purge
- 𝒮 (Sensor / Divination Probe): Sample recursion before commit
- 𝒱 (Visual Schema Template): Structured imaginal interface
- 𝑀 (Multi-Agent Phase Protocol): Recursion across souls

### Validation Criteria (lines 1769-1777):
- Coverage Check: Every FSCTF operator has at least 3 independent esoteric witnesses
- Closure Check: All operator outputs feed back into system (no untracked branches)
- Extension Saturation: Every major esoteric feature outside FSCTF is captured via an operator
- Bireflection Integrity: Each morphism must have a co-morphism or reflection pathway
- Grace Containment: System must allow state-recovery without contradiction
- Devourer Isolation: False attractors must be contained and distinguished
- Sovereign Bootstrapping: System must support autonomous recursion that doesn't require external input

### Next Steps (lines 1783-1786):
1. Populate each operator with canonical esoteric examples and textual quotes
2. Formalize extension operators as recursive classes
3. Build diagrammatic visualizations of morphic recursion trees
4. Implement a validator agent to verify closure, grace integrity, and devourer containment
