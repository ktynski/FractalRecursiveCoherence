This auditor could not see our codebase and is going off the readme, what is valid and what is not?

This updated version of the theory is even more ambitious, claiming to have solved the "free parameter" problem and to have derived the entire universe from literally nothing.

The core claims have been strengthened, but the fundamental issues of **peer review, rigorous derivation, and independent experimental validation remain unaddressed**.

### ## What's New?

The author has introduced a foundational narrative called the **"Ex Nihilo Bootstrap,"** which attempts to provide a cause-and-effect chain starting from the void (‚àÖ) and ending with the Standard Model.

1.  **From Nothing (Ex Nihilo) üåå:** The central new claim is that the `N=21` graph isn't just a starting point, but the *inevitable result* of a stability sequence. The chain `‚àÖ (void) ‚Üí quantum fluctuation ‚Üí entangled pair ‚Üí œÜ-stabilization ‚Üí self-replication ‚Üí N=21 Ring+Cross` is presented as a necessary, assumption-free process.

2.  **Truly Zero Free Parameters üéØ:** Previously, the theory required three "input scales" to set the masses. The author now claims to have derived the most important one, the electroweak VEV (`v`), directly from the Planck mass and mathematical constants. This elevates the claim from a massive parameter reduction to a **complete, zero-free-parameter theory**.

3.  **Specific, Falsifiable Predictions üî™:** The theory now lays out explicit, near-term experimental tests that the author agrees would **kill the theory** if they fail. The most prominent is the prediction that the neutrino mixing angle `Œ∏‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ` will be measured by the JUNO experiment to be `35.26¬∞`. This is a strong, falsifiable claim.

4.  **Interactive "Experimental" Proof üî¨:** A major addition is the interactive WebGL simulation. The author presents this not just as a visual aid, but as a form of **real-time experimental validation** where one can manipulate the physics and verify conservation laws.

### ## Does This Address the Missing Pieces?

While the new additions make the theory's narrative more complete and its claims even bolder, it **does not resolve the core scientific shortcomings**.

* **Peer Review:** An interactive website and a README file are still not substitutes for formal, anonymous peer review by independent experts. The fundamental validation process is still missing.
* **Rigorous Derivation:** The "Ex Nihilo Bootstrap" is a compelling story, but it's presented as a descriptive sequence, not a rigorous mathematical proof. Key steps like "only œÜ-phases survive (KAM theorem)" or "Ring+Cross N=21 (UNIQUE stable configuration)" are enormous assertions that would each require entire papers of evidence.
* **Experimental Evidence:**
    * **The Good:** Making specific, falsifiable predictions (like the JUNO result) is a huge step in the right direction. This is exactly what a real scientific theory should do.
    * **The Bad:** The interactive simulation, while technically impressive, is **not experimental evidence**. It's a simulation of the theory's *own rules*. It can show that the author's code is self-consistent, but it cannot show that the theory correctly describes reality.

In essence, the author has built a more elaborate and internally consistent world, but has not yet built the bridge connecting that world to our own through the established scientific method. The falsifiable predictions are the most promising new feature, as they provide a clear, near-term path to either validate or completely discredit the entire framework.
