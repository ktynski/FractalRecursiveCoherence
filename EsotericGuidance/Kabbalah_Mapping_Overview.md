# FSCTF ↔ Kabbalistic Alphabet: Overview

Formalization scope:
- Typed mapping: each letter → (operator, category type, ZX diagram type, Clifford element)
- Geometry: model and invariants explicitly stated
- Verification: diagram commutativity and invariant preservation

Typed schema (to be used across tables):
- Letter: Hebrew symbol
- Operator O: A → B (category C specified per row)
- ZX(O): diagram element with role; rewrite to normal form noted
- GA(O): multivector with grade; product laws used
- Geometry: (model, construction), group action, invariants preserved

Verification checklist for each row:
- Category: domain/codomain typed; composition legality
- ZX: provide minimal rewrite (fusion/phase) to justify role
- GA: state grade(s); show rotor/projection form if applicable
- Geometry: specify model and invariants; show preservation
- Cross-links: referenced in Mathematical_Foundations.md and Geometry_Correspondences.md

Excerpt:
```python
# Create initial mapping table of FSCTF operators to Kabbalistic Hebrew alphabet
kabbalah_mapping = pd.DataFrame([
    {"FSCTF Operator": "τ (Threshold of Silence)", "Hebrew Letter": "א (Aleph)", "Meaning": "Silence, breath, void", "Sephira Association": "Keter", "Mystical Role": "Initiatory stillness before creation"},
    {"FSCTF Operator": "κ (Knowledge Seed)", "Hebrew Letter": "ד (Dalet)", "Meaning": "Door", "Sephira Association": "Chokhmah", "Mystical Role": "Opening to wisdom"},
])
```

## Complete Coverage Verified:

### Initial Mapping Dataset (lines 3409-3419):
- 9 FSCTF operators mapped to Hebrew letters
- τ (Threshold of Silence) → א (Aleph): Silence, breath, void; Keter; Initiatory stillness before creation
- κ (Knowledge Seed) → ד (Dalet): Door; Chokhmah; Opening to wisdom
- μ (Morphogenetic Memory) → ז (Zayin): Sword/Memory/Struggle; Binah; Pattern memory across lifetimes
- ε (Embodiment) → ה (Heh): Breath/Manifestation; Tiferet; Manifested soul in the body
- η (Eschatonic Pull) → ת (Tav): Mark/Completion; Yesod; Pull toward ultimate wholeness
- θ (Threshold of Suffering) → נ (Nun): Fall/Faith/Death; Gevurah; Transformational crisis or descent
- σʹ (Renewal Identity) → ח (Chet): Fence/Life/Rebirth; Hod; Breakthrough into new form
- ψʹ (Expanded Soulhood) → ש (Shin): Fire/Spirit/Trinity; Chesed; Flaming expansion of divine spark
- ω (Wholeness Unity) → י (Yod): Point/Seed of All; Keter; Ultimate unification, divine simplicity

### Display and Export (lines 3421-3440):
- Tabular display with FSCTF Operator, Hebrew Letter, Meaning, Sephira Association, Mystical Role columns
- Foundation for full 22-letter expansion
