# Mathematical Foundations (FIRM)

Purpose: formal scaffolding for all mappings and claims. No empirical tuning; derivations proceed from definitions and axioms.

## 1. Categories, objects, morphisms
- A category C consists of Obj(C), Hom_C(A,B), identity 1_A, and associative composition ∘.
- All diagrams referenced must commute explicitly (provide nodes, arrows, and equalities of composites).

## 2. Monoidal structure
- (C, ⊗, I, α, λ, ρ) is a monoidal category with tensor ⊗, unit I, and coherence isomorphisms α, λ, ρ.
- When we speak of “combining” operators, we model this via ⊗ or via categorical products/sums as appropriate.

## 3. Functors and natural transformations
- A functor F: C → D preserves identities and composition.
- A natural transformation η: F ⇒ G is given by components η_A: F(A) → G(A) s.t. ∀f: A→B, G(f)∘η_A = η_B∘F(f).

## 4. Limits and colimits
- A cone over a diagram D: J→C is (L, λ_j: L→D(j)). L is a limit if it is terminal among cones.
- Dually, colimits are initial among cocones. We use these to interpret “aggregation”/“coalescence” claims.

## 5. Adjunctions and dualities
- An adjunction L ⊣ R between categories C and D is data (L: C→D, R: D→C, η: 1_C ⇒ R∘L, ε: L∘R ⇒ 1_D) with triangle equalities.
- Formal dualities (e.g., bireflection) must be realized as contravariant involutions or explicit adjunctions.

## 6. Operator typing (signatures)
- Each FIRM operator O must be typed:
  - Domain and codomain objects in a stated category C
  - Its role under ⊗ (monoidal), and whether it preserves/reflects limits or colimits
  - If represented diagrammatically (ZX/Clifford), provide the interpretation functors:
    - J_ZX: C → ZX (diagrammatic calculus)
    - J_GA: C → GA (geometric algebra representations)
- Example signature schema (to fill per operator in the dedicated tables):
  - O: A → B, O ⊗ I_B ≅ O, preserves finite limits (yes/no), left adjoint exists (yes/no)

## 7. Verification protocol (math-first)
- Category check: domains/codomains declared; identities and compositions well-typed.
- Diagram check: all cited diagrams commute; give explicit equalities of composites.
- Monoidal check: uses of ⊗ respect associators/unitors; note strictification assumptions if any.
- Limit/colimit check: if claiming a (co)universal property, provide the universal arrow factorization.
- Adjunction check: supply units/counits and verify triangle identities.
- Representation check: ZX reductions justified via axioms; GA elements typed with grades and products.
- Invariant check: geometric/topological invariants stated and preserved under the claimed maps.
- Separation of concerns: numerical results documented separately; no scalings introduced to fit data.

## 7. FSCTF Category Validation

### Grace Operator Consistency Check:
**Claim**: 𝒢 : ∅ → Ψ is unique morphism from initial to terminal object.
**Files checked**: `Formal_Derivation_Reference.md`, `Glossary_and_Symbols.md`, `Visual_Atlas.md`, `ZX_Calculus_Formalism.md`
**Status**: ✓ CONSISTENT - All files specify same typing

### Bireflection Functor Validation:
**Claim**: β is contravariant endofunctor with β∘β = 1_A
**ZX Implementation**: H-conjugation (color change Z ↔ X)
