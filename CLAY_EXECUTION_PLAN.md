## NAVIER-STOKES: Complete Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: φ-Balance as Global Attractor (3 months)

**Goal**: Prove that ANY smooth initial data becomes φ-balanced in finite time

#### Task NS-1.1: Grace as Strict Lyapunov Function ⏳
**What to prove**: 
```
For u(x,t) solving Navier-Stokes:
d/dt G(u) < 0  whenever G(u) ≠ G_equilibrium
```

**Approach**:
1. Start with Grace functional: `G(u) = ⟨∇u⟩₀` (Clifford scalar from velocity gradient)
2. Compute time derivative: `dG/dt = ⟨∂_t(∇u)⟩₀`
3. Substitute NS: `∂_t u = ν∆u - (u·∇)u - ∇p`
4. Show: `dG/dt = -ν⟨∇²u⟩₀ - ⟨(u·∇)∇u⟩₀`
5. Prove negative definite for non-φ-balanced states

**Expected result**: Lemma stating Grace is strict Lyapunov function

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 6/10

---

#### Task NS-1.2: Convergence Rate Estimate ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
t_balance ≤ C · (ν / ‖u₀‖²_{H^s})
```

**Approach**:
1. Use Lyapunov decay: `G(t) - G_eq ≤ (G(0) - G_eq) · exp(-λt)`
2. Relate λ to viscosity ν and initial data norm
3. Define t_balance: time when `|G(t) - G_eq| < ε`
4. Derive explicit bound

**Expected result**: Quantitative convergence estimate

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 7/10

---

#### Task NS-1.3: Global Attractor Theorem ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
For ANY u₀ ∈ H^s(ℝ³) with div(u₀)=0 and s≥3:
∃ t_balance < ∞ such that |G(u(t)) - G_eq| < ε for all t > t_balance
```

**Approach**:
1. Combine Lyapunov function + convergence estimate
2. Show trajectory enters φ-balanced neighborhood
3. Prove it stays there (stability)
4. This removes "conditional" from our proof!

**Expected result**: **KEY THEOREM** - All solutions become φ-balanced

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 8/10 (This is the critical step!)

---

### Phase 2: Energy Bounds & No Blow-Up (2 months)

#### Task NS-2.1: Energy Inequality with Grace ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
d/dt(E(u) + λG(u)) ≤ -C·(E + λG)
```
where E = ∫|u|²dx is kinetic energy

**Approach**:
1. Standard NS energy: `dE/dt = -2ν∫|∇u|²dx ≤ 0`
2. Add Grace: `d/dt(E + λG) = dE/dt + λ·dG/dt`
3. Choose λ optimally to make right side decay exponentially
4. This gives uniform bound for all time

**Expected result**: Combined energy functional decays

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 6/10

---

#### Task NS-2.2: A Priori Bounds for All Derivatives ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
sup_{t>0} ∫|∇ᵏu(x,t)|² dx < ∞  for all k ≥ 0
```

**Approach**:
1. Use φ-balance: once achieved, Grace prevents concentration
2. Bootstrap: bound on ∇u ⇒ bound on ∇²u ⇒ ... ⇒ bound on ∇ᵏu
3. Use Sobolev embedding + interpolation inequalities
4. Key: φ-balance provides "regularization" at all scales

**Expected result**: All Sobolev norms bounded uniformly

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 7/10

---

#### Task NS-2.3: No Blow-Up Theorem ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
For all t ∈ (0,∞): ‖u(·,t)‖_{H^s} < ∞
```
(No finite-time singularities)

**Approach**:
1. Suppose blow-up at time T: `‖u(·,t)‖_{H^s} → ∞` as t → T
2. This requires `∇ᵏu → ∞` for some k
3. But Phase 2.2 bounds all derivatives uniformly
4. Contradiction! ⇒ No blow-up possible

**Expected result**: **KEY THEOREM** - Smooth solutions exist globally

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 6/10 (follows from 2.2)

---

### Phase 3: Uniqueness & Continuous Dependence (1.5 months)

#### Task NS-3.1: Uniqueness via Contraction ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
If u₁, u₂ both solve NS with same initial data u₀:
then u₁ ≡ u₂
```

**Approach**:
1. Consider difference w = u₁ - u₂
2. Show w satisfies linear equation with source term
3. Use FIRM metric: `d/dt ‖w‖_{φ,G} ≤ -κ‖w‖_{φ,G}`
4. Conclude: `‖w(t)‖_{φ,G} ≤ ‖w(0)‖_{φ,G}·exp(-κt) = 0`

**Expected result**: Unique solution theorem

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 5/10 (standard technique)

---

#### Task NS-3.2: Continuous Dependence ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
‖u₁(t) - u₂(t)‖_{H^s} ≤ C·‖u₁(0) - u₂(0)‖_{H^s}·exp(λt)
```

**Approach**:
1. Similar to uniqueness but with non-zero initial difference
2. Lipschitz continuity in appropriate norm
3. Shows solution map is continuous

**Expected result**: Well-posedness (continuous dependence on data)

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 4/10

---

### Phase 4: Full Regularity & Writing (2 months)

#### Task NS-4.1: Bootstrap for C^∞ Smoothness ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
If u₀ ∈ C^∞, then u(·,t) ∈ C^∞ for all t > 0
```

**Approach**:
1. φ-balanced ⇒ bounds on all ∇ᵏu (from Phase 2.2)
2. Use elliptic regularity for pressure
3. Bootstrap: finite regularity ⇒ infinite regularity
4. Show all derivatives remain bounded

**Expected result**: Full regularity theorem

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Difficulty**: 6/10

---

#### Task NS-4.2: Combine into Main Theorem ⏳
**What to prove**:
```
THEOREM (Navier-Stokes Global Regularity):
For any u₀ ∈ H^s(ℝ³) with s≥3 and div(u₀)=0:
1. ∃! global solution u ∈ C^∞((0,∞) × ℝ³)
2. sup_{t>0} ∫|u(x,t)|² dx < ∞
3. u depends continuously on u₀
