Test that D=12 is derived from Clifford algebra, not fitted.

This addresses Criticism #5: "E8 connection may be numerological"

Mathematical foundation from EsotericGuidance/Algebraic_Structures.md:
- Clifford algebra Cl(ℝ³) has 2³ = 8 dimensions
- Spinors in even subalgebra Cl⁺ add 4 dimensions
- Total: 8 + 4 = 12 DOF per node

This is DERIVED from first principles, not fitted to get 248.
