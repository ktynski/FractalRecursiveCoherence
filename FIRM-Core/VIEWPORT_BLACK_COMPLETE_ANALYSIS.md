# Black Viewport - Complete Deep Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Systematic exhaustive analysis

---

## What Works

✅ Evolution logic runs (Hebrew letters, triads, coherence calculations in console)  
✅ ZX engine exists (`hasEngine: true`)  
✅ Snapshot exists (`hasSnapshot: true`)  
✅ Clifford field exists as `MultivectorField` in snapshot  
✅ Render loop IS running  
✅ WebGL context is valid  

---

## What Doesn't Work

❌ Viewport is completely black  
❌ `systemState.cliffordField` is never populated  
❌ Renderer sees `hasField: false`  

---

## Diagnostic Trail

### Logs That Appear:
1. `🔍 ENGINE CHECK: {hasEngine: true}` - line 1472
2. `🌌 Evolution: bootstrap | Coherence: 0.68` - line 1490
3. `🔍 CLIFFORD FIELD DIAGNOSTIC: {hasField: true, fieldType: MultivectorField}` - line 1503
4. `🎨 RENDERER CHECK: {hasField: false}` - renderer.js:789

### Logs That DON'T Appear:
❌ `✅ FIELD ASSIGNED` - line 1520 (NEVER LOGS)

---

## The Contradiction

**CRITICAL PARADOX:**
- Line 1490 (`🌌 Evolution`) **LOGS** ✅
- Line 1503 (`CLIFFORD FIELD DIAGNOSTIC`) **LOGS** ✅  
- Line 1520 (`FIELD ASSIGNED`) **NEVER LOGS** ❌

All three are inside the same `if (zxEvolutionEngine)` block (starting line 1476).

**Lines 1490 → 1503 → 1520 should execute sequentially**, but 1520 never runs.

---

## Possible Explanations

1. **Hidden Early Return**: Code throws/returns between 1503 and 1520
2. **Async Timing**: Diagnostics log out of order due to async operations
3. **Multiple Code Paths**: There are multiple `if (zxEvolutionEngine)` blocks
4. **State Object Scope**: `systemState` is being reset/replaced
5. **Renderer Timing**: Renderer runs BEFORE field assignment completes

---

## Next Steps

Need to add diagnostic at line 1513 (right before assignment block) to pinpoint exact failure point.

OR 

Check if there are multiple execution paths / code duplication that's causing confusion about which block actually runs.

---

**Status**: Requires ONE MORE precise diagnostic at line 1512-1513 OR complete re-audit of code flow from line 1476-1700.
