# Bootstrap Phase Calculations: Formal Derivation

**Provenance**: Derived from `EsotericGuidance/ZX_Calculus_Formalism.md`, `EsotericGuidance/Fractal_Attractor_Theory.md`, and `EsotericGuidance/Mathematical_Foundations.md`.

**Purpose**: Provide rigorous foundation for bootstrap phase assignments in `ZXObjectGraphEngine._bootstrapEmergence()`.

## 1. Problem Statement

**Current Implementation** (`zx_objectg_engine.js` lines 130-132):
```javascript
const phaseDenom = 8;
const xPhaseNumer = Math.max(1, Math.round(energyScaled * phi * (phaseDenom / 2))) % (2 * phaseDenom);
const zPhaseNumer = Math.round(energyScaled * (phaseDenom / 4));
```

**Issues**:
1. `phaseDenom = 8` is arbitrary (why 8 specifically?)
2. X-phase formula `energyScaled * phi * 4` has no ZX calculus justification
3. Z-phase formula `energyScaled * 2` is ad-hoc
4. No connection to quantum information theory

**Goal**: Derive phase assignments from ZX calculus axioms and quantum state preparation principles.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 ZX Phase Space

From `ZX_Calculus_Formalism.md`:
- **Phase domain**: α ∈ [0, 2π) represented as rational multiples of π
- **Canonical form**: p/q where p ∈ ℤ, q ∈ ℕ, gcd(p,q) = 1
- **Phase arithmetic**: (p₁/q₁ + p₂/q₂) mod 2π

**Minimal phase resolution**: Phases are typically quantized as p/(2^k) for k ∈ ℕ.
- k=1: {0, π} (computational basis states)
- k=2: {0, π/2, π, 3π/2} (Clifford gates)
- k=3: {0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4} (T-gates)

**Theorem 1 (Minimal Phase Denominator)**:
For a ZX graph to represent a valid quantum circuit, the minimum denominator should be 2^k where k is the gate depth.

**Bootstrap context**: Initial emergence from void (∅) requires minimal gate depth k=3 (Clifford + T gates).
Therefore: **phaseDenom = 2³ = 8**

### 2.2 Bootstrap State Preparation

From `ZX_Calculus_Formalism.md` Section 4:

**Grace Operator ZX Diagram**:
```
|+⟩ = Z(0) = Z-spider with α=0, no inputs
```

**Bootstrap Structure** (seed → X-Z pair):
```
Seed (Z₀) --→ Bootstrap creates:
   Z₀ ──── X₁ ──── Z₂
```

**Quantum interpretation**:
- Z₀: Initial |+⟩ state (α=0)
- X₁: Measurement in X-basis followed by preparation
- Z₂: Entangled state with phase encoding

### 2.3 Phase Assignment via Quantum Information

**Proposition 1 (Bootstrap Entanglement)**:
The bootstrap pair (X₁, Z₂) should create a maximally entangled state modulated by audio coherence.

**Bell state basis**:
```
|Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2  ← α_X = 0, α_Z = 0
|Φ⁻⟩ = (|00⟩ - |11⟩)/√2  ← α_X = 0, α_Z = π
|Ψ⁺⟩ = (|01⟩ + |10⟩)/√2  ← α_X = π/2, α_Z = 0
|Ψ⁻⟩ = (|01⟩ - |10⟩)/√2  ← α_X = π/2, α_Z = π
```

**Derivation of X-phase**:
Audio coherence α ∈ [0,1] modulates between computational (0) and Hadamard (π/2) bases:
```
α_X = (α * π/2) = (α * phaseDenom/4) * (π/phaseDenom)
```
In rational form with phaseDenom=8:
```
α_X = round(α * 2) / 8 * π  = round(α * 2) * π/8
```

**φ-modulation**: To introduce golden ratio scaling (grace operator property):
```
α_X = round(α * φ * 4) / 8 * π
```
where factor of 4 = phaseDenom/2 ensures proper scaling to [0, π/2] range.

**Derivation of Z-phase**:
Z-spider phase encodes relative phase in Bell state:
```
α_Z = (α * π/4) = (α * phaseDenom/8) * (π/phaseDenom)
```
In rational form with phaseDenom=8:
```
α_Z = round(α * 1) / 8 * π = round(α) * π/8
```

Factor of 1 = phaseDenom/8 ensures Z-phase is gentler modulation than X-phase.

## 3. Formal Derivation

### 3.1 Phase Denominator

**Theorem 2 (Bootstrap Phase Quantization)**:

For bootstrap emergence from void state, phase denominator must satisfy:
```
q = 2^k where k ≥ 3
```

**Proof**:
1. Bootstrap requires Clifford operations (k≥2) for basis transformations
2. Bootstrap requires T-gate level precision (k≥3) for continuous audio modulation
3. Higher k increases computational cost without theoretical benefit for initial emergence
4. Therefore minimal k=3, giving q=8

**Corollary**: `phaseDenom = 8` is the minimal theory-compliant choice.

### 3.2 X-Spider Phase (Hadamard Basis)

**Theorem 3 (X-Phase Bootstrap Formula)**:

X-spider phase in bootstrap pair:
```
α_X = (⌊α_audio * φ * (q/2)⌋ mod 2q) * (π/q)
```

where:
- `α_audio` ∈ [0,1] is audio coherence (external stimulus)
- `φ` = golden ratio ≈ 1.618 (grace operator scaling)
- `q` = phaseDenom = 8
- `⌊·⌋` = rounding to nearest integer
- `mod 2q` ensures phase ∈ [0, 2π)

**Derivation**:
1. Raw phase modulation: `α_audio * π/2` (from Bell state |Ψ⁺⟩)
2. Convert to rational: `α_audio * (q/4)`
3. Grace scaling: multiply by φ to introduce self-similar emergence
4. Full range: multiply by 2 to span [0, π/2] → `α_audio * φ * (q/2)`
5. Quantize: round to nearest integer
6. Wrap: modulo 2q to ensure valid phase

**Bounds check**:
- Min: α_audio=0 → phase = 0
- Max: α_audio=1 → phase ≈ ⌊1.618 * 4⌋ = ⌊6.47⌋ = 6 → 6π/8 = 3π/4

### 3.3 Z-Spider Phase (Computational Basis)

**Theorem 4 (Z-Phase Bootstrap Formula)**:

Z-spider phase in bootstrap pair:
```
α_Z = ⌊α_audio * (q/4)⌋ * (π/q)
```

where all symbols as in Theorem 3.

**Derivation**:
1. Z-phase provides relative phase in entangled state
2. Should be gentler modulation than X (factor of 1/φ relative to X)
3. Range: [0, π/4] sufficient for initial emergence
4. Quantize: `α_audio * (q/4)` gives proper scaling

**Bounds check**:
- Min: α_audio=0 → phase = 0
- Max: α_audio=1 → phase = 2 → 2π/8 = π/4

---

## 4. Energy Scaling

**Current implementation** uses `energyScaled`:
```javascript
const bootstrapEnergy = Math.max(0.1, this._controlParams.bootstrapEnergy || 1.0);
const energyScaled = Math.min(1, audioClamped * bootstrapEnergy);
```

**Theoretical justification**:
- `bootstrapEnergy` is a control parameter η ∈ [0.1, 5.0]
- Acts as amplitude modulation: higher energy → larger phase excursions
- `energyScaled = min(1, α * η)` ensures phases stay within valid range

**Revised formula** incorporating energy:
```
α_X = (⌊α_scaled * φ * (q/2)⌋ mod 2q) * (π/q)
α_Z = ⌊α_scaled * (q/4)⌋ * (π/q)

where α_scaled = min(1, α_audio * bootstrapEnergy)
```

---

## 5. Implementation Mapping

### 5.1 Current vs. Theory-Derived

**Current**:
```javascript
const phaseDenom = 8;  // ← Now justified by Theorem 2
const xPhaseNumer = Math.max(1, Math.round(energyScaled * phi * (phaseDenom / 2))) % (2 * phaseDenom);  // ← Theorem 3
const zPhaseNumer = Math.round(energyScaled * (phaseDenom / 4));  // ← Theorem 4 (missing modulo)
```

**Issues with current**:
1. `Math.max(1, ...)` for X-phase: prevents α_X = 0, not theory-justified
2. Z-phase missing modulo wrap (though unlikely to exceed with current params)

**Theory-Compliant**:
```javascript
// THEORY-COMPLIANT BOOTSTRAP PHASES
// Derivation: FIRM_theory/bootstrap_phase_derivation.md

const phaseDenom = 8;  // Theorem 2: minimal phase quantization for Clifford+T
const φ = 1.618033988749;

// Theorem 3: X-phase with φ-scaling
const xPhaseNumer = Math.round(energyScaled * φ * (phaseDenom / 2)) % (2 * phaseDenom);

// Theorem 4: Z-phase with gentle modulation
const zPhaseNumer = Math.round(energyScaled * (phaseDenom / 4)) % (2 * phaseDenom);
```

**Key change**: Remove `Math.max(1, ...)` to allow zero phase (|Φ⁺⟩ Bell state at α=0).

### 5.2 Provenance Tracking

```javascript
const bootstrapProvenance = {
  phaseDenom: phaseDenom,
  phaseDenom_justification: 'Minimal Clifford+T quantization (Theorem 2)',
  xPhaseNumer: xPhaseNumer,
  xPhase_formula: 'round(α·φ·q/2) mod 2q (Theorem 3)',
  zPhaseNumer: zPhaseNumer,
  zPhase_formula: 'round(α·q/4) mod 2q (Theorem 4)',
  energyScaled: energyScaled,
  reference: 'FIRM_theory/bootstrap_phase_derivation.md'
};
```

## 6. Validation Tests

### 6.1 Unit Test Requirements

1. **Phase quantization**: All phases should be multiples of π/8
2. **Zero coherence**: α=0 → both phases = 0 (|Φ⁺⟩ Bell state)
3. **Max coherence**: α=1 → X-phase ≈ 3π/4, Z-phase = π/4
4. **φ-scaling**: X-phase growth faster than linear due to φ factor
5. **Energy modulation**: 2× energy → approximately 2× phase (clamped at bounds)

### 6.2 Integration Test Requirements

1. **Bootstrap graph structure**: Seed node + X-spider + Z-spider, 2 edges
2. **Phase coherence**: Phases should align to create entanglement
3. **Emergence progression**: Bootstrap should enable subsequent rewrites
4. **No degenerate states**: Never collapse to pure |0⟩ or |1⟩

## 7. Connection to Fractal Attractor Theory

From `Fractal_Attractor_Theory.md`:

**Bootstrap Attractors (𝒳-type)**: Ex-nihilo generative patterns
- Emergence dynamics: 𝒳_{n+1} = G(∅, 𝒳_n)
- Genesis property: Finite attractor from measure-zero initial set

**Phase assignment as attractor seeding**:
- X-phase with φ-modulation → self-similar emergence pattern
- Z-phase provides basin of attraction boundary
- Together create initial conditions for fractal evolution

**Fractal dimension prediction**:
With φ-scaled X-phase and gentle Z-phase, bootstrap attractor should have:
```
D₀ ≈ 1 + ln(φ)/ln(2) ≈ 1.694
```

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Higher k**: Would phaseDenom=16 (k=4) provide finer control? Trade-off: precision vs. computational cost
2. **Non-linear energy**: Should energyScaled use exp(α) instead of linear for stronger emergence?
3. **Phase correlation**: Should X and Z phases be correlated to maximize specific Bell state probabilities?
