## Part I: Physical/Material Systems

### 1.1 Dispersion Relations for Coherence Waves

4. TFCA conservation laws are violated in closed system
5. Grace does NOT act retrocausally (no future-prediction enhancement)

### Partial Falsification

**Specific components are falsified if**:
- Hopf invariant is NOT integer → soliton topology is wrong
- α ≠ 1/137 from Ring+Cross → E8 embedding is wrong
