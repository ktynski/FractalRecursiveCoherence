# CRITICAL ERRORS IN MY RECENT CHANGES
**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Severity**: üî¥ HIGH - I made incorrect changes based on assumptions

---

## Summary

I incorrectly modified several values that **WERE actually specified in theory**. The theory document `complete_sovereignty_emergence_specification.md` contains the exact implementation with all these values.

---

## Errors Made

### 1. ‚ùå REMOVED POLARITY OFFSET (-0.1) - **INCORRECT REMOVAL**

**Theory specification** (line 198):
```javascript
const polarityFromGrace = 2 * graceRatio - 0.1;
```

**My change**: Removed the `-0.1` offset

**Why this was wrong**: The `-0.1` IS in the theory specification. I assumed it was arbitrary bias, but it's part of the formal specification.

**Status**: üî¥ NEEDS REVERSION

---

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGED COHERENCE THRESHOLD (0.5 ‚Üí œÜ^-1) - **UNCLEAR**

**Theory specification** (line 107):
```javascript
if (coherence > 0.5) {  // Threshold from golden ratio œÜ^-1 ‚âà 0.618
```

**My change**: Changed threshold to `1 / œÜ` (‚âà 0.618)

**Why this is unclear**: 
- Code says `0.5`
- Comment says "from golden ratio œÜ^-1 ‚âà 0.618"
- These don't match!

**Possible interpretations**:
1. The code (0.5) is correct, comment is wrong
2. The comment is correct, code (0.5) should be 0.618
3. 0.5 is intentionally different from œÜ^-1 despite comment

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS USER CLARIFICATION

---

### 3. ‚úÖ TYPE DIVERSITY (0.3) - **IN THEORY, CORRECTLY DOCUMENTED**

**Theory specification** (line 145):
```javascript
const typeDiversity = (hasZ && hasX) ? 1.0 : 0.3;
```

**My action**: Documented as needing justification

**Status**: Actually in theory spec, no change needed

---

### 4. ‚úÖ TERMINALITY MULTIPLIER (3) - **IN THEORY, CORRECTLY DOCUMENTED**

**Theory specification** (line 250):
```javascript
const terminality = maxDegree / (avgDegree * 3);
```

**My action**: Documented as needing justification

**Status**: Actually in theory spec, no change needed

---

### 5. ‚úÖ DEVOURER THRESHOLD (5) - **IN THEORY, CORRECTLY DOCUMENTED**

**Theory specification** (line 283):
```javascript
if (degree > 5 && !triadNodes.has(nodeId)) {
```

**My action**: Documented as needing justification

**Status**: Actually in theory spec, no change needed

---

## Root Cause

I did not thoroughly search `complete_sovereignty_emergence_specification.md` before making changes. This 910-line document contains the **complete reference implementation** with all coefficients, thresholds, and formulas explicitly stated.

**I should have read this document line-by-line before making ANY changes.**

---

## Required Actions

### IMMEDIATE

1. **Revert polarity offset removal** - Restore `-0.1` in `computePolarityOrientation`
2. **Clarify coherence threshold** - Ask user if 0.5 or œÜ^-1 is correct

### SYSTEMATIC

1. **Read entire specification document** before making changes
2. **Search for numeric values** in theory docs before assuming they're arbitrary
3. **Cross-reference ALL changes** against formal specification

---

## Lesson Learned

**The formal specification document IS the source of truth.**

When a complete specification exists (`complete_sovereignty_emergence_specification.md`), ALL implementation details should be verified against it before assuming they are heuristic or arbitrary.

My previous approach:
- ‚ùå Saw a constant ‚Üí assumed it was heuristic
- ‚ùå Made changes based on general principles

Correct approach:
- ‚úÖ See a constant ‚Üí search specification document
- ‚úÖ Find exact formula with provenance
- ‚úÖ Only flag as heuristic if genuinely missing from spec

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Previous confidence**: 80% (thought I understood the theory)  
**Current confidence**: 40% (realized I didn't read the spec thoroughly)  
**Required confidence**: 99% (must read ALL theory docs before proceeding)

**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED  
**Action**: REVERT INCORRECT CHANGES + READ FULL SPECIFICATION
