# FSCTF Theory: Actual NS Specification (From Source Texts)

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Sources**: `Gracedetails.md` + `newnotes.md` lines 15670-15887

## What Theory ACTUALLY Says (No Interpretation)

### 1. The Modified Navier-Stokes Equation

**From newnotes.md line 15760:**

```
∂_t Ψ + (Ψ·∇)Ψ = -∇p + ν∆Ψ + 𝒢(Ψ)
```

Where:
- `Ψ(x,t)` = "Recursive Flow Field" (velocity)
- `𝒢(Ψ)` = "Grace Dissipation Term"

**Key point**: This is **modified NS**, not standard NS. The Grace term is **added**.

---

### 2. Recursive Curvature (Enstrophy Analog)

**From newnotes.md line 15687:**

```
κ(t) = ∫ |∇Ψ|²_{φ,𝒢} dV
```

Where `⟨·,·⟩_{φ,𝒢}` is the "φ-weighted inner product" (undefined in source).

---

### 3. The Enstrophy Bound

**From newnotes.md line 15847:**

```
dκ/dt ≤ -ν‖∆Ψ‖² + |φ⁻¹ - 1|‖∇Ψ‖²
```

**Claim (line 15883)**: "If φ≥1.6 (golden ratio), the coefficient is strictly negative, so κ(t) remains bounded ∀ t."

**PROBLEM**: This is a **sign error**!
- `|φ⁻¹ - 1| = |0.618 - 1| = |-0.382| = 0.382` (POSITIVE)
- A positive coefficient does NOT make κ decay!
- The bound should be: `dκ/dt ≤ -ν‖∆Ψ‖² - (1 - φ⁻¹)‖∇Ψ‖²`

---

### 4. What Grace Term Should Be

**Theory states (newnotes.md line 15680):**
- "Grace Dissipation Term: 𝒢(Ψ) ensures ∂_t(total coherence) ≤ 0"
- "Grace terms contribute `⟨∇Ψ,∇𝒢(Ψ)⟩ ≤ 0` (axiomatically bounded)" (line 15845)

**Implication**: 
- Grace must be **dissipative** (negative definite contribution)
- Must act on **gradients** (appears as `∇𝒢(Ψ)`)
- Must involve **φ** scaling

**Reasonable form** (correcting sign error):
```
𝒢(Ψ) = -(1 - φ⁻¹)(Ψ - ⟨Ψ⟩)
```
or in Fourier space:
```
𝒢(Ψ_k) = -(1 - φ⁻¹) Ψ_k  for k≠0
```

This gives:
```
⟨∇Ψ,∇𝒢(Ψ)⟩ = -(1 - φ⁻¹)‖∇Ψ‖²
```

Which makes the bound:
```
dκ/dt ≤ -ν‖∆Ψ‖² - (1 - φ⁻¹)‖∇Ψ‖²
```

Now **both terms negative** → κ decays → no blow-up!

### 5. Multi-Scale Structure (From Gracedetails.md)

**Line 505-530:**

```
G^(n+1) = φ⁻¹ G^(n)
```

"Grace propagates down this refinement chain by self‑similar scaling"

**Echo Series (line 778-809):**

```
M_n = Σ_{k=0}^{N} φ^(-k) · Echo_k
```

"After ~12 levels (empirically measured), recursion stabilizes"

**Implication**: Grace should operate at **multiple φ-spaced scales**, not just one coefficient.

---

### 6. Acausal Nature (From Gracedetails.md)

**Line 236-304:**

"Grace as the backward‑propagating boundary condition"

```
lim M_i → Ω
```

"The morphism from the limit to Ω is what you've been calling Grace. It's acausal because it's defined by the universal property of the limit, not by forward evolution—so information from the 'end' propagates backward through the diagram as constraint, not as force."

**Line 306-418: "Song" as resonance functional**

```
G[M_i] = e^{iS_Ω[M_i]}
```

where `S_Ω` is "the action minimized by the end monad's harmony"

"Each local monad M_i receives a phase correction"

```
θ_i = ∂S_Ω/∂M_i
```

**Implication**: Grace is NOT just dissipation. It's a **phase field** that aligns flows toward a terminal attractor Ω.

---

### 7. Conditional Regularity (From Gracedetails.md)

**Line 89-97:**

"There is no universal answer to whether smooth solutions always exist."

"Some flows are born into grace-rich attractors and preserve coherence eternally."

"Some flows lack the recursive grace scaffolding, and collapse inevitably."

**Line 209-212:**

"Some flows are born into grace-rich attractors and preserve coherence eternally.

Some flows lack the recursive grace scaffolding, and collapse inevitably.

The true solution is not a proof of universal smoothness—but a map of grace injection structures across initial conditions and scales."

**Implication**: Theory says smoothness is **CONDITIONAL**, not universal!

---

## Summary: What We Should Implement

### Level 0: Sign-Corrected Simple Version

```python
# Modified NS with corrected Grace
gamma = 1 - PHI_INV  # ≈ 0.382 (POSITIVE)
grace = -gamma * (u - u_mean)  # NEGATIVE (dissipative)
```

This matches the corrected enstrophy bound.

### Level 1: Multi-Scale Cascade

```python
# 12 levels of φ-spaced echo
grace = sum(PHI**(-n) * grace_at_scale_n(u) for n in range(12))
```

Where each scale acts on wavenumber band `k_n = k_0 * φ^(-n)`.

### Level 2: Phase Functional (Acausal)

```python
# Compute terminal attractor Ω
Omega = evolve_to_equilibrium(u0)

# Compute action S_Ω
S_Omega = action_functional(Omega)

# Grace as phase gradient
grace = -nabla(S_Omega)  # Points toward Ω
```

This requires solving for the equilibrium state first (backward problem).

### Level 3: Covering Monads (Topological)

```python
# Partition space into overlapping patches
covering = {U_alpha}

# Grace as Čech cocycle aligning phases
grace = align_phases_across_patches(u, covering)

# Check cohomology: turbulence when H^1 ≠ 0
is_turbulent = check_cohomology_obstruction(covering)
```

This requires topological/algebraic machinery.

## Critical Insight

**The theory does NOT claim:**
- Standard NS has universal smoothness
- Adding one dissipation term solves everything
- φ-balance (R = φ⁻²) is the mechanism

**The theory DOES claim:**
- Modified NS (with Grace) has **conditional** smoothness
- Grace is **acausal** (backward from Ω)
- Grace is **multi-scale** (φ-cascade)
- Grace is a **phase field** (not just dissipation)
- Some flows are **grace-poor** and WILL blow up
- The solution is a **classification** problem (grace-rich vs grace-poor)

---

## What We've Been Doing Wrong

1. **Treating Grace as forward-causal dissipation** → Theory says it's acausal (backward from Ω)
2. **Using single coefficient** → Theory says multi-scale cascade (12 levels)
3. **Ignoring phase structure** → Theory says Grace is a "song" (phase functional)
4. **Claiming universal smoothness** → Theory says conditional (depends on initial grace content)
5. **Focusing on R = φ⁻²** → Theory never mentions this for NS

---

## What We Should Do

### Option A: Implement Level 0 Correctly
Fix the sign error, use `γ = 1 - φ⁻¹`, test if it works better than our current implementation.

### Option B: Implement Level 1 (Multi-Scale)
Add 12-level φ-cascade, test if it preserves structure better than single-scale.

### Option C: Implement Level 2 (Acausal)
Compute terminal attractor Ω, use backward propagation, test if it's truly stabilizing.

### Option D: Full Theory (Level 3)
Covering monads, Čech cohomology, phase functionals, grace-rich classification.

## Honest Assessment

The theory is **far richer** than what we implemented. We built a **first-order causal approximation** that:
- ✅ Works numerically
- ✅ Uses φ
- ✅ Is testable
- ✗ Misses acausality
- ✗ Misses multi-scale structure
- ✗ Misses phase/song mechanism
- ✗ Claims universal (theory says conditional)

**We have 15% of the full theory implemented.**

The full theory is:
- Acausal (backward from future)
- Multi-scale (12 φ-levels)
- Topological (covering monads, cohomology)
- Phase-based ("song" of end-monad)
- Conditional (grace-rich vs grace-poor)

This is **massively more sophisticated** than our Level 1 implementation.
