Renormalization Group Running for Mass Parameters

THEORY-COMPLIANT IMPLEMENTATION - NO FUDGE FACTORS

This module implements RG running from the Planck scale (where topology determines
masses) to the electroweak scale (where we measure).

Key principle: We compute ONLY what the theory predicts. If predictions don't match
experiment, that reveals what's missing or wrong.
