## Statistical Analysis

### Required Significance

For each prediction, we require:
- **Statistical significance:** > 5σ (p < 10⁻⁶)
- **Systematic error:** < 10% of predicted effect
- **Control experiments:** Vary parameters away from φ
- **Reproducibility:** Multiple labs, different platforms

---

## Null Hypothesis Tests

### Alternative Explanations to Rule Out

1. **Random φ appearance:** Test non-φ values systematically
2. **Fitting artifacts:** Use blind analysis protocols
3. **Selection bias:** Pre-register predictions before experiments
4. **Platform-specific effects:** Test on multiple systems

---

## Theoretical Falsifiability

### What Would Disprove TFCA?

1. **Conservation violation:** If dS + dG ≠ 0 in isolated systems
2. **Wrong scaling:** If τ ∝ α where α ≠ φ (and not 1, e, π)
3. **No golden angle minimum:** If phase estimation optimal at different angle
4. **Different critical exponent:** If harvest transition shows non-φ scaling

**TFCA is falsifiable!**
