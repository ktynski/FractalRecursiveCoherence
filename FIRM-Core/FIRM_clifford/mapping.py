ZX → Clifford mapping Φ and discrete Dirac dynamics.

- Φ maps Z-spiders to scalar rotors, X-spiders to phase bivectors, wires to the
  geometric product structure.
- Mass term m emerges as the first nonzero eigenvalue of Δ = [Φ(G_t) − Φ(G_{t-1})].
- Connection is built from rotor phase deltas; curvature via bivector commutator.
