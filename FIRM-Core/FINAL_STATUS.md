# FINAL STATUS - Black Viewport Issue

## ✅ Issues 1 & 2 FULLY RESOLVED
- **Issue 1**: Harmonic generator module not loading → Fixed by adding explicit imports
- **Issue 2**: Bins error from denominators > 64 → Fixed by clamping in `add_phases_qpi`

## ⚠️ Issue 3 - Partial Progress, Deeper Problem Found

###What I Fixed:
- Removed early return in `main.js` (line 1573) that blocked observer logic  
- Removed early return in `renderer.js` (line 799-802) that blocked `renderFrame()` calls
- Made renderer attempt to render even with null field

### Current State:
- **Render loop CRASHES** - `isRunning: false`
- **`frameCount` stuck at 0** - `renderFrame()` never successfully completes
- **Viewport still black**
- Evolution logic works perfectly (Hebrew letters, grace emergence, triads all functioning)

### Root Cause (Updated):
The render loop crashes because:
1. `cliffordField` is `null` when `renderFrame()` is called  
2. `renderFrame()` doesn't handle null field gracefully
3. An exception is thrown, triggering `catch` block at renderer.js:810-813
4. Renderer stops with `this.stop()`

### The REAL Problem:
**The `cliffordField` is NEVER populated in `systemState` when the renderer checks it.**

Despite evolution creating the field, the render callback's state object doesn't receive it. This suggests:
- State object scope/timing issue
- The callback closure captures stale state
- Field assignment happens after callback executes

### What's Needed:
1. Find the actual error message from render loop crash (check console for "Render loop error:")
2. Make `renderFrame()` handle null field gracefully (render black/fallback)
3. OR fix the root state propagation issue so field actually reaches renderer

### Files Modified:
- `FIRM-Core/FIRM_ui/main.js` - Removed early return, made observer conditional
- `FIRM-Core/FIRM_ui/renderer.js` - Removed early return blocking renderFrame
- `FIRM-Core/FIRM_ui/FIRM_dsl/core.js` - Clamped phase denominators to 64
- `FIRM-Core/FIRM_ui/harmonic_generator.js` - (indirectly via imports in main.js)
