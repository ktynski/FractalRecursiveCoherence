Deep Theoretical Exploration: Answering the Fundamental Questions

We need to understand:
1. WHY ring+cross? What makes this topology special?
2. WHY 100 phase quantization steps?
3. WHERE does the 19/80 factor really come from?
4. HOW does spacetime itself emerge from this?
5. WHAT is the dark matter topology?
