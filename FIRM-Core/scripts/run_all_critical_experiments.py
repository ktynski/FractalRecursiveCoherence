Master Experiment Runner: Definitive Test of FIRM Claims

This runs all critical experiments to determine:
1. Is Œ± = 1/137 real or coincidence?
2. Does continuum limit exist?
3. Can destructive interference be fixed?
4. What claims are justified vs overclaimed?

2. NEEDS MORE WORK (Physical Interpretation):

   ‚Ä¢ Lorentz invariance needs clearer test methodology
   ‚Ä¢ Gauge symmetry needs improvement to <0.1% violation

   ‚Ä¢ Drop "90% complete" claims
   ‚Ä¢ Focus on specific, verifiable computational results
   ‚Ä¢ Timeline: Years of peer review + independent replication

RECOMMENDED PAPER TITLE:
  "Emergent Quantum-Like Interference from Discrete Graph Dynamics:
   A ZX-Calculus Approach"

HONEST ABSTRACT:
  "We present a computational framework based on ZX-calculus graph rewrites
   that exhibits quantum-like interference patterns. Through systematic testing,
   we demonstrate constructive interference matching Born rule predictions (3.94
   vs classical 2.0) and approximate gauge symmetry (~1% violation). We discuss
   potential physical interpretations and identify areas requiring further
   theoretical development. This work suggests that discrete graph dynamics may
   serve as a substrate for quantum-like computational phenomena."
