# Metamirror Transformation Summary

## Status (October 2025)

- The previous `zx_evolution.js` metamirror stack has been removed. The live system now uses `ZXObjectGraphEngine` for deterministically evolving ObjectG graphs and publishing canonical snapshots.  
- Rendering pipelines (`main.js`, `renderer.js`) consume snapshot data; no metamirror heuristics run in the current build.

## Why Metamirrors Were Disabled

- The original implementation mixed heuristics (Metamirror, Grace, bootstrap) in a single monolithic module.  
- Snapshot-driven ObjectG evolution plus certified coherence tests now provide the mathematically grounded behaviour we need.  
- Further metamirror work will be reconsidered once the shader pipeline consumes real Clifford data and the remaining theory tasks (tasks 8.3, 7.2) are complete.

## Verification

- `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_rendering.py`  
- `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_structure.py`  
- `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_ui_pipeline_consistency.py`

All 39 tests pass after swapping in the ObjectG engine and removing the metamirror layer.

## Next Steps

1. Rewire `renderer.js` to visualise the snapshot Clifford field directly.  
2. Gate sacred/fractal modules behind proofs (todo task 8.3).  
3. Re-run the full theory validation suite once the shader pipeline is theory-compliant.
