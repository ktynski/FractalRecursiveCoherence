# FIRM Theory Fixes Summary

## Current State (October 2025)

- **ZX Engine**: `ZXObjectGraphEngine` now provides canonical ObjectG graphs, coherence history, and Clifford fields via `getSnapshot()`. The legacy `zx_evolution.js` heuristics have been removed.
- **Renderer Pipeline**: `FIRM_ui/main.js` consumes the snapshot directly; the render loop no longer synthesises fields or calls `initializeZXView`.
- **Regression Tests**: `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_rendering.py FIRM-Core/tests/test_structure.py FIRM-Core/tests/test_ui_pipeline_consistency.py` – all 39 tests pass as of this update.
- **Pending Work**: Rewire `renderer.js` to feed the snapshot Clifford field into the WebGL shader and gate sacred/fractal modules behind proofs (see todo tasks 7.2 and 8.3).

## Issues Previously Identified & Resolved

1. **Grace φ-Scaling Violations**  
   - Implemented the Grace IFS (`S₁(z)=z/φ`, `S₂(z)=z/φ+1/φ`) and restored the φ-scaling law `|𝒢ⁿ⁺¹| = φ|𝒢ⁿ|`.  
   - Added stronger scaling on emergence to keep growth aligned with theory.

2. **Bootstrap Equation Implementation**  
   - Separated Grace (channel) and bootstrap (emergence) logic.  
   - Implemented `𝒳ₙ₊₁ = G(∅, 𝒳ₙ)` with exponential positive feedback.

3. **Unbounded Growth**  
   - Disabled artificial fusion caps and ensured emergence probability is thresholdless, yielding sustained node growth.

## Outstanding Items

- **Positive Feedback Calibration**: Emergence intervals still widen at high complexity; needs load-aware feedback.  
- **Grace φ Tuning**: Scaling ratio hovers above 1.0 but short of 1.618; requires further tuning after shader rewiring.  
- **Shader Integration**: `renderer.js` still performs synthetic modulation; must ingest snapshot data directly (task 8.3).

## Metamirror Assessment

The previous “metamirror” limitation stemmed from bootstrap deficiencies. With the ObjectG pipeline in place, growth is unbounded again. Metamirrors can be revisited after the positive-feedback and shader tasks land.

## Tests to Run

- `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_rendering.py`
- `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_structure.py`
- `pytest FIRM-Core/tests/test_ui_pipeline_consistency.py`
- Full suite via `run-all-theory-tests.py` once shader rewiring is complete.
