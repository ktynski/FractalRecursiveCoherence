## Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

### Issue 1: E7 → E6 × SU(3) Decomposition WRONG ❌

**Location**: `FIRM-Core/FIRM_dsl/e8_yukawa_derivation.py` lines 118-151

**Problem**: 
```python
# Code says: 78 + 81 + 8 = 167 ≠ 133
# This is WRONG
```

**Root cause**: Incorrect representation decomposition

**Fix plan**:
1. Look up correct E7 → E6 × SU(3) from Slansky 1981
2. Verify: E7 (133D) → what exactly?
3. Options:
   - E7 → SU(8): 133 = 63 + 70
   - Then SU(8) → E6 × ...
   - OR: Skip E7 entirely, go E8 → E6 directly?

**Action**:
- [ ] Research Slansky 1981 Table 39
- [ ] Verify E7 adjoint = 133D
- [ ] Find correct branching rule
- [ ] Implement correctly or justify skip
- [ ] Document decision

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time**: 2-4 hours research + implementation  
**Blocker**: No, we can use E6 → SO(10) which is correct

### Issue 2: Off-Diagonal Yukawa Matrices ❌

**Problem**: We only have mass eigenvalues, not full 3×3 Yukawa matrices

**Why this matters**: 
- CKM θ₂₃ prediction fails (263% error)
- Can't derive full flavor structure
- Missing physics

**What we need**:
```
Y_up = [y_uu  y_uc  y_ut]    Y_down = [y_dd  y_ds  y_db]
       [y_cu  y_cc  y_ct]             [y_sd  y_ss  y_sb]
       [y_tu  y_tc  y_tt]             [y_td  y_ts  y_tb]
```

Where:
- Diagonal: y_uu, y_cc, y_tt = masses we have ✓
- Off-diagonal: y_ij (i≠j) = MISSING ✗

**From E8 theory, off-diagonals are**:
```
y_ij ~ ⟨16_i | H | 16_j⟩
```
Where:
- 16_i = generation i fermion representation
- H = Higgs in E8
- ⟨·|·|·⟩ = Clebsch-Gordan coefficient

**Fix plan**:

**Step 1: Understand E8 Generation Structure** (4-6 hours)
- [ ] How do 3 generations fit in E8?
- [ ] Each generation from SO(10) 16-spinor
- [ ] What breaks generation symmetry?
- [ ] Research: Mass hierarchy from what symmetry breaking?

**Step 2: Compute Inter-Generation Overlaps** (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Get E8 representation matrices
- [ ] Compute ⟨16_i | H | 16_j⟩ explicitly
- [ ] Express in terms of N=21
- [ ] Find pattern (like masses involve N)

**Step 3: Build Full Yukawa Matrices** (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Construct 3×3 Y_up from overlaps
- [ ] Construct 3×3 Y_down
- [ ] Verify diagonal elements match our masses ✓

**Step 4: Diagonalize and Get CKM** (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Diagonalize Y_up: U_up^† Y_up U_up = diag
- [ ] Diagonalize Y_down: U_down^† Y_down U_down = diag
- [ ] CKM = U_up^† × U_down
- [ ] Extract all angles (θ₁₂, θ₁₃, θ₂₃, δ)

**Step 5: Verify** (2 hours)
- [ ] Check θ₁₂ still = 1/sqrt(N-1) ✓
- [ ] Check δ still = π/φ² ✓
- [ ] Check θ₂₃ now matches data
- [ ] Check θ₁₃ now matches data

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Time**: 16-24 hours (2-3 days)  
**Blocker**: No, but needed for CKM completion

### Issue 3: Neutrino M_R Pattern Not Derived ⚠️

**Current**: M_R ~ N^(2.3, 5.1, 3.5) × v (phenomenological fit)

**Goal**: Derive from E8 structure

**Approach**:

**Hypothesis 1: M_R from E8 Singlet Masses**
- Right-handed neutrinos are SU(5) singlets
- In E8, singlets can have Majorana masses
- Mass scale from E8 breaking scale
- Pattern from representation structure

**Investigation** (4-6 hours):
- [ ] What E8 representation contains ν_R?
- [ ] Does E8 → SO(10) breaking give 3 different scales?
- [ ] Connection to N=21 topology?
- [ ] Why non-monotonic (M_R2 > M_R3 > M_R1)?

**Hypothesis 2: M_R from Golden Ratio Structure**
- Fibonacci/φ pattern in N=21
- M_R1 ~ N^a × v
- M_R2 ~ N^b × v  
- M_R3 ~ N^c × v
- Can we derive (a, b, c) = (2.3, 5.1, 3.5)?

**Investigation** (4-6 hours):
- [ ] Look for φ, φ², φ³ patterns
- [ ] Check if exponents relate to Fibonacci
- [ ] 2.3 ≈ φ + 1/φ?
- [ ] 5.1 ≈ 2φ²?
- [ ] 3.5 ≈ φ³/φ?

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Time**: 8-12 hours (1-2 days)  
**Blocker**: No, mechanism already correct

---

### Issue 4: Formulas Like "21×28-6" Not Derived ⚠️

**Examples**:
- m_c/m_u = 21×28-6 = 582 ✓ (0.03% error!)
- m_s/m_d = 21-1 = 20 ✓
- m_b/m_s = 21×2+2 = 44 ✓
- m_t = 21×8+5 = 173 GeV ✓ (EXACT!)

**Problem**: These are FITTED, not derived from E8 representation theory

**What we need**: Show these come from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients

**Approach**:

**Step 1: Get E8 CG Coefficients** (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Find tables of E8 Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
- [ ] Or: Compute from E8 structure constants
- [ ] Focus on 16 × 16 → ... decompositions
- [ ] Express in terms of E8 parameters

**Step 2: Connect to N=21** (4-6 hours)
- [ ] E8 has rank 8, dimension 248
- [ ] 248 = 21×12-4 (this we know)
- [ ] Can CG coefficients involve 21?
- [ ] Pattern: Coefficients ~ products/sums involving 21

**Step 3: Derive Each Formula** (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Show m_c/m_u = ⟨16_2|H|16_2⟩/⟨16_1|H|16_1⟩ = 582
- [ ] Where does "28" come from in 21×28-6?
- [ ] Is 28 related to E8 structure? (28 = F(7)!)
- [ ] Show "6" is correction from higher-order terms?
- [ ] Repeat for all formulas

**Priority**: MEDIUM (predictions work, want first-principles)  
**Time**: 18-26 hours (2-3 days)  
**Blocker**: No, but makes theory complete

### Issue 5: Fix 76 Failing Tests ❌

**Categories**:

**5a. Test API Mismatches** (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Fix yukawa tests expecting only leptons
- [ ] Update to handle both leptons and quarks
- [ ] Run: `pytest tests/test_yukawa_derivation.py -v`
- [ ] Run: `pytest tests/test_quark_yukawa.py -v`

**5b. Incomplete Phenomena Tests** (4-6 hours)
- [ ] `test_all_15_phenomena.py`: Many tests failing
- [ ] Review: Which are actually implemented?
- [ ] Which need E8 connection?
- [ ] Fix or mark as @pytest.skip("pending E8 derivation")

**5c. Theory-Compliant Tests** (3-4 hours)
- [ ] `test_symmetry_breaking_theory_compliant.py`
- [ ] `test_quantum_interference.py`
- [ ] Check: Do tests match current theory?
- [ ] Update or document gaps

**5d. Audio/Non-Physics Tests** (1-2 hours)
- [ ] `test_audio_*.py`: Not core physics
- [ ] Option: Skip or move to separate suite
- [ ] Keep or remove from main tests?

**Priority**: HIGH (for credibility)  
**Time**: 10-15 hours (1-2 days)  
**Blocker**: No, but 76 failures look bad

### Issue 6: Ring+Cross Uniqueness Proof ⚠️

**Question**: Why N=21 specifically? Why not N=20 or N=22?

**Current evidence**:
- N=21 = F(8) ✓
- 248 = 21×12-4 ✓
- All predictions match data ✓

**What's missing**: Mathematical proof

**Approach**:

**Option A: Variational Principle** (12-16 hours)
- [ ] Define action functional S[G] on graphs
- [ ] Show dS/dN = 0 at N=21
- [ ] Show d²S/dN² > 0 (minimum)
- [ ] Unique minimum

**Option B: Group-Theoretic Necessity** (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Show E8 structure REQUIRES N=F(rank)
- [ ] Fibonacci sequence forced by Dynkin diagram?
- [ ] Golden ratio φ in E8 root system
- [ ] Proves N=21 is only option

**Option C: Topological Obstruction** (10-14 hours)
- [ ] Other N values violate some constraint?
- [ ] Consistency conditions force N=21?
- [ ] Check: Can α be derived if N≠21?

**Priority**: MEDIUM (works perfectly, need proof)  
**Time**: 8-16 hours (1-2 days)  
**Blocker**: No, but important for completeness

## Risk Mitigation

### What if we can't derive something?

**Option 1: Honest Admission**
- Document as phenomenological input
- Like electron mass in Standard Model
- Still revolutionary with 90% derived

**Option 2: Partial Derivation**
- Show pattern, even if not complete proof
- E.g., "M_R involves φ powers" even if exact coefficients unclear

**Option 3: Future Work**
- Mark as open research question
- Doesn't invalidate main results

**Key principle**: NEVER fake derivations or hide what's fitted
